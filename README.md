Brighter Boston is a web application where residents can submit municipal issues, including potholes and dim streetlights.
Brighter Boston is my 'Breakable Toy' (capstone project) for [Launch Academy](http://www.launchacademy.com/).

This app is based on The City of Boston's [Citizens Connect](https://mayors24.cityofboston.gov:4443/).
